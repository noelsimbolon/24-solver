## Overview
This is a Java implementation to solve the 24 card game using brute force algorithm.

### 24 Card Game
The 24 card game is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24.
For example, for the numbers 4, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is ( 7 − ( 8 ÷ 8 ) ) × 4 = 24.

The 24 card game is usually played with the French-suited, standard 52-card pack which comprises 13 ranks in each of the four suits.
Each suit includes three court cards (face cards), King, Queen and Jack.
Each suit also includes ten numeral cards or pip cards, from one to ten.
The card with one pip is known as an Ace.

The value of each pip card are determined by its number.
For Ace, Jack, Queen, and King, their values are 1, 11, 12, and 13 respectively.
